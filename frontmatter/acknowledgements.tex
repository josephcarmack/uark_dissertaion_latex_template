\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

This is where you write your acknowledgements page. If you want a dedication
page, add another file to the frontmatter directory and name it something
like ``dedication.tex''. Write your dedication there and make sure and include
it in the dissertation.tex file with the other frontmatter .tex files.
